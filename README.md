# Advanced Home Lab Project for Malware Analysis and SOC Simulation

## Objective

The objective of this advanced home lab project is to create a controlled environment for simulating realistic cyber incidents, including malware attacks, using three virtual machines (VMs): a Kali Linux machine for offensive security operations, a Windows machine as the target/victim, and a Security Operations Center (SOC) VM for monitoring and analysis. This setup will allow you to practice incident response, threat detection, and analysis in a secure and isolated environment, gaining practical experience with a variety of tools used in a real-world SOC environment.

### Skills Developed

* Malware Analysis: Practice generating and analyzing malware to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs).
* Tool Proficiency: Develop skills using a range of cybersecurity tools, including Sysmon, Splunk, Zeek, and Elastic Stack.
* Network Configuration: Enhance your ability to configure and secure virtual machines and networks.
* Data Analysis: Strengthen skills in generating and analyzing telemetry data to understand system behavior during incidents.
* Incident Response: Gain experience in detecting, analyzing, containing, and remediating security incidents.

### Tools and Resources
- **Vultr:** Cloud provider for creating and managing virtual machines.
- **Kali Linux:** Linux distribution used for penetration testing and offensive security tasks.
- **Windows Machine:** To act as the target and generate telemetry.
- **SOC VM (Ubuntu Server/Desktop)**: Centralized monitoring system with tools like Splunk, Zeek, and Wireshark.
- **[Sysmon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ7pv6blyog):** For detailed system monitoring and logging.
- **[Splunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaBJ-PK8_RI&list=PLG6KGSNK4PuC_YKHjJWCOvlp7XIZfIh8v&index=7):** For analyzing logs and detecting incidents.
- **[Wireshark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZlasFStzqM&list=PLG6KGSNK4PuC_YKHjJWCOvlp7XIZfIh8v&index=25):** For capturing and analyzing network traffic.
- **[Zeek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBid7AZ5w4A):** For network monitoring and intrusion detection.
- **[Microsoft Sentinel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BAG80PWR4Y):** For additional SIEM capabilities.
- **[Velociraptor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9pQ2g-18o4):** For endpoint monitoring and analysis.
- **Microsoft Defender:** For endpoint protection.

## Step 1: Build the Lab Environment

1. Create VMs: Set up Kali Linux, Windows, and Ubuntu VMs using a cloud provider or local virtualization software.
2. Configure Network: Use a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to ensure the VMs can communicate securely.

## Step 2: Simulate the Incident

**Objective:** Create realistic conditions for the incident.
1. Create Malicious Activity:

    * **Phishing Email:** Simulate a phishing email. You can use tools like the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) in Kali Linux to generate a phishing email with a malicious attachment or link.
    * **Deploy Ransomware:** Use a controlled ransomware simulator or a benign version of ransomware. Ensure this is done in a contained environment to avoid real damage.

2. Deploy Monitoring:
    * **Configure Alerts:** Set up alerts in Splunk or Sentinel for suspicious activities such as file encryption or unusual network traffic.
    * **Capture Traffic:** Use Wireshark and Zeek to capture and analyze network traffic during the incident.

## Step 3: Detect and Analyze the Incident

**Objective:** Identify and understand the incident using your tools.

1. Detection:

    * **Monitor Alerts:** Review alerts generated by your SIEM and EDR tools. Look for anomalies or indicators of compromise.
    * **Analyze Logs:** Use Splunk or Sentinel to search for indicators of compromise (IoCs) and analyze log data related to the incident.

2. Investigation:

    * **Network Analysis:** Use Wireshark and Zeek to analyze network traffic. Look for signs of ransomware spreading or communicating with a command-and-control server.
    * **Endpoint Analysis:** Use Defender and Velociraptor to investigate affected endpoints. Check for signs of encryption and the presence of ransomware notes.

## Step 4: Respond to the Incident
**Objective:** Take appropriate actions to contain, eradicate, and recover from the incident.

1. Containment:

    * **Isolate Affected Systems:** Disconnect affected VMs or endpoints from the network to prevent further spread.
    * **Block Threats:** Update firewall rules or use network segmentation to block malicious traffic.
2. Eradication:

    * **Remove Malware:** Use anti-malware tools to remove the ransomware from affected systems.
    * **Patch Vulnerabilities:** Apply patches or updates to address any vulnerabilities exploited by the ransomware.
3. Recovery:

    * **Restore Systems:** Restore affected systems from backups and verify that they are clean and functioning correctly.
    * **Monitor for Reoccurrence:** Continue monitoring to ensure the incident does not recur.

## Step 5: Post-Incident Analysis
**Objective:** Evaluate the incident response and learn from the experience.

1. Conduct a Post-Mortem:

    * **Review Actions:** Assess the effectiveness of the incident response process, including detection, analysis, and resolution.
    * **Identify Improvements:** Document lessons learned and identify areas for improvement.
2. Create a Report:
    * **Incident Overview:** Provide a summary of the incident, including the scenario, impact, and response actions.
    * **Detailed Analysis:** Include details on detection, investigation, containment, eradication, and recovery.
    * **Recommendations:** Offer suggestions for improving incident response procedures and preventive measures.
