| 2024-10-13 04:30:37    | Suspicious Eventlog Clearing Activity      | Command executed: `wevtutil cl System` (duplicate of previous).                                                                                             |
| 2024-10-13 04:31:09    | Suspicious Eventlog Clearing Activity      | Command executed: `wevtutil cl security` to clear the Security event log.                                                                                   |
| 2024-10-13 05:32:12    | Suspicious Eventlog Clearing Activity      | Command executed: `wevtutil cl security /c:10` to clear the last 10 events in the Security event log.                                                       |
| 2024-10-13 05:32:27    | Suspicious Eventlog Clearing Activity      | Command executed: `wevtutil cl security` to clear the Security event log again.                                                                             |
| 2024-10-11 03:26:49    | Use Short Name Path in Command Line       | Command executed: `wevtutil im "C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\2\MAN8.tmp"` using the short name path for a potentially malicious file.                |

### Event Analysis
- **Tools Involved:** The tool `wevtutil.exe`, located in `C:\Windows\system32\`, is a legitimate Windows executable used for managing event logs. However, its usage in clearing logs is concerning as it may indicate an attempt to cover tracks following malicious activity.
- **User Context:** The commands were executed under the `EC2AMAZ-H6D1H61\Administrator` user account, which typically has elevated privileges, raising suspicion regarding the intent behind the log clearing.
- **Processes Involved:** The commands were initiated by `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe`, which are common command-line interfaces on Windows systems, further obscuring the malicious activity. 

### Event Correlation
The pattern of clearing both System and Security logs within a short timeframe suggests a deliberate effort to erase potential traces of unauthorized actions. The duplicate event clearing commands also indicate an ongoing attempt to ensure log records do not capture relevant information.

### Potential Impact
If this activity is determined to be malicious, it could indicate a compromise of the `Administrator` account or a potentially exploited vulnerability. The clearing of logs significantly hampers incident detection and response efforts, allowing further malicious activities to go undetected.

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected instance to prevent further malicious actions.
   - Preserve all logs and event data prior to isolation to maintain evidence for further analysis.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected instance, focusing on:
     - User activity leading up to the event log clearing.
     - Network traffic analysis to identify any unauthorized external communications.
     - Review of additional system logs for other potential indicators of compromise (IoCs).

3. **Mitigation Measures:**
   - Strengthen access controls for sensitive accounts, particularly those with administrative privileges.
   - Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms for suspicious use of `wevtutil.exe` and other administrative tools.
   - Educate staff on the importance of log integrity and the implications of log clearing on incident response capabilities.

4. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Analyze the incident's root cause and develop a report summarizing findings, actions taken, and lessons learned.
   - Update incident response plans and security policies based on insights from this incident.

## Conclusion
The analysis of the suspicious events related to event log clearing indicates a significant risk to the security posture of the environment. Immediate containment and thorough investigation are essential to determine the extent of any potential compromise and to restore confidence in the integrity of the logging and monitoring systems.
